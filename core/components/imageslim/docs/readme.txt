The Image Slenderizer, for MODX.

Tired of clients junking up content areas and richtext TVs with
enormous images?  Simply follow these 3 easy steps!

1. Install.
2. Apply a generous helping of imageSlim to the affected area:
   [[*content:imageSlim]]
3. Watch that excess page weight melt away.

imageSlim looks through an HTML fragment for \<img\> tags, compares each
image's natural size to its desired size and if needed calls phpThumbOf
to size it down.
